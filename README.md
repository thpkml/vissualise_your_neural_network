# Visualise your neural network
Create an amazing large format visualisation of a neural network for wall posters
## What
This simple app takes your input image and colour settings to create a beautiful image of  
neural network with connections. The resulting output can be downloaded as a huge 4800px wide image if you want to print it for a wall poster. 

## How
If you want to play around with the code yourself, feel free to clone the repo. 
- npm install (to get the required dependencies) 
- check the python file vis.py and make sure you have the required python modules (virtual env. recommended)
- node app.js (to run the app on localhost port 3000) 

## Tech
- Node.js: (Express.js, EJS, Semantic UI, Multer, child_process etc.)
- Python: (Matplotlib, Numpy, PIL, json etc.)
